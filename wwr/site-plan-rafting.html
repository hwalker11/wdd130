    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of my site will be to advertise my fictional white water rafting website as a fun option for vacations and other adventures. I want to pull in potential customers with a nice design and the promise of a positive experience.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is primarily families looking for a fun activity to go on together. I am focused on families that are looking for something fun to do that will bond them and bring them closer together. I imagine they would primarily access the site on desktop so that they can all look at it together.</p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/a8f0e2-8dc0f7-ffffff-ffd599"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/a8f0e2-8dc0f7-ffffff-ffd599</a>

        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">[#A8F0E2]</td>
