    <h2>Harrison Walker</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Harrison Walker, I am 20 years old, and I am looking to major in Applied Technology. I love reading, writing, playing video games, and playing my piano.</p>
    <p>Some of the main reasons I'm learning about programming and web design is that the idea of programming and writing code really interests and excites me as an option for my career. You can really find a lot of work with that skillset in today's world, I imagine. Or at least I hope so.</p>
    <p>I was born into the Covenant and was baptized at 8 years old, and my favorite scripture is Ether 12:27, a great scripture about the Atonement and the eternal process that is self-improvement.</p>
